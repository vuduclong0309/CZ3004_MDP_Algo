CZ3004_MDP_Algo_Grp15
------------------

The project's target is to build an efficient exploration solution for a robot to discover an uninformed maze; and calculate the shortest possible path to travel from a predetermined start zone to end zone, during which the robot also have to travel through a way point

There are two versions of this project : PC version and RPI version. PC version is for virtual demonstration, algorithm discovery and algorithm testing without connecting to the real robot. Preferred and tested algorithm would be transferred to RPI version, this version mainly deals with stable robot communication and used for real arena run. Detailed comment of the code is available in RPI version

This project was assembled using IntellijIDEA Ultimate 2018, with support files for Eclipse. For best testing experience, I'd recommend using Intellij.

Achieved result
-------------------
A. Exploration: 1:58s (1st place)
B. Fastest Path Finding: 14s (4th place), 11s + 10 (1 obstacle hit)
C. Arrow image recognition challenge: 6th place

Total number of participated team: 25

Kudos for everyone in the team for a spendid result <3
