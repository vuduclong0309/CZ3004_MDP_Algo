------------------

This project build an efficient exploration solution for a robot to discover an uninformed maze; and calculate the shortest possible path to travel from predetermined start zone to end zone 

There is two version: PC version and RPI version in 2 corresponding folder. PC version is for algorithm testing without a need of robot. RPI version is used for real arena run. Detailed comment of the code is available in RPI version

This project was assembled using IntellijIDEA Ultimate 2018 with support file for Eclipse. For best testing experience, I'd recommend using Intellij. This project is not tested in other IDE.

Achieved result
-------------------
A. Exploration: 1:58s (1st place)
B. Fastest Path Finding: 14s (4th place), 11s + 10 (1 obstacle hit)
C. Arrow image recognition challenge: 6th place

Kudos for everyone in the team for a spendid result <3
